Today was a warm Friday, the run felt long and the legs felt tired. My spirit however was high and unbroken.  
There is a certain feeling of accomplishment when the kilometres ticked by on the watch and a feeling of pride when the 10 appears rises up. When I arrive at the beach and look at the sea apprehension creeps in but once I get my feet wet, stick my shoulders in and control my breath a lovely calmness takes hold and the remaining 9 minutes in the water are a joy.  

Tomorrow, I will be kick starting the explanations of the various initiatives that Nurture Africa do in Nansana and surrounding areas. Tune in to tomorrow's video and read the blog to see what the first initiative I choose is.

Here is the vlog for Day 5.
