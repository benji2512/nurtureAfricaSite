Day 8 consisted of a walk to try and limit any injury I would inevitably get if I ran. Calves and ankles were still sore during the walk so I was very happy I decided to walk. With kilometre 100 only a couple of days away, I really want to run the last 10k so not being injured is a priority.  

In the video outro below, I describe what I will be doing in Uganda. Which is working in the Vocation Education centre, teaching the basics of a computer and how to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint to create CV's and other useful skills that will benefit with attaining a job/starting your own business.  

Here is the vlog for Day 8.
