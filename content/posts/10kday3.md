Day 3 was tough.  
A warm Wednesday did contribute to the toughness but general fatigue was the main culprit. Like I said in the video below, me being uncomfortable for 2 hours a day for 10 days really in nothing in the grand scheme of things.  

I love getting out and doing this, it's a really good way of combining something I am pationate about with something I want to get better at.  

I say a lot in the video about how this short term suffering is shadowed by what people in Uganda face, please do watch, I feel it is really important to try and understand.
