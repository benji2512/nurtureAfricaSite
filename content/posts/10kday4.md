Thursday, 18th May was day 4 and by far the toughest day so far.  

My body, especially ankles and calves, were sore and tired. I have been very lucky this week in regards to the weather. Joining the local farmers with making the most of the dry, warm conditions.  

Special thanks to everyone on the Supporters Wall for donating their well earned money to the cause. At the end of the 10 days, I will collate a list of people who supported in other ways and add them there too.  

40km down, 60km to go.  

Below is the vlog for day 4, Enjoy!
