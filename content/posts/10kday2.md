Tuesday, 16 May 2023 was day 2 of running 10 kilometers for 10 days in a bid to raise as much money and attention for Nurture Africa. Lovely warm day made the run pleasant but also made it harder. The added 10 minutes in the sea starts out with me being a stuttering mess and within 1 minute being calm and enjoying the cold.  

To the people who have donated so far, THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart. To everyone who has liked, shared and interacted with my social media posts, THANK YOU.  

Everyone who has contributed so far I cannot thank enough. The exposure I hope to generate is soo important.  

Below is day 2's vlog:
